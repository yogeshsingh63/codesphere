## Setup
CodeSphere utilizes Docker containers to safely execute untrusted code. You need to pull the correct images so that this functionality works correctly. Make sure the user you both run the following commands and run CodeSphere as is `root`, or is in the `docker` group!

Run the following setup commands to pull the necessary Docker images:
```bash
docker pull stepik/epicbox-gcc:6.3.0
docker pull stepik/epicbox-mono:5.0.0
docker pull stepik/epicbox-mono:5.0.0
docker pull stepik/epicbox-java:11.0.1
docker pull strellic/epicbox-node:latest
docker pull strellic/epicbox-python:latest
docker pull strellic/rust-sandbox:latest
```

After this, you should have downloaded all of the Docker images needed.
From there, follow the setup instructions in each of the folders.
